**Review Summary**:

- ✅ Tests reviewed: __tests__/unit.test.ts
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ No lint errors
- ✅ No type errors
- ✅ Branded types with runtime validation implemented
- ✅ Error handling follows discriminated union pattern
- ✅ Effect.Service pattern correctly implemented
- ✅ Naming conventions followed (MemoryClientApi interface, MemoryClient service class)

**Key Fixes Applied**:
- Converted `MemoryClient` type to `MemoryClientApi` interface with comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Moved `getOption` helper function from `api.ts` to `helpers.ts` for better organization
- Extracted magic numbers into `constants.ts` with meaningful names (MAX_MEMORY_KEY_LENGTH, MAX_MEMORY_VALUE_SIZE_BYTES, MAX_NAMESPACE_LENGTH)
- Introduced branded types (`MemoryKey`, `MemoryValue`, `Namespace`) with runtime validation using `Brand.refined`
- Introduced branded number types (`NonNegativeInteger`, `PositiveInteger`) for type safety
- Created `MemoryValueMap` global type for `ReadonlyMap<string, string | undefined>`
- Renamed service class from `MemoryClientImpl` to `MemoryClient` (removed "Impl" suffix)
- Renamed interface from `MemoryClient` to `MemoryClientApi` (added "Api" suffix)
- Fixed regex performance issue by moving `NAMESPACE_PATTERN` to top-level constant
