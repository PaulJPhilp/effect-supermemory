**Review Summary**:
- ✅ All files reviewed: api.ts, errors.ts, types.ts, service.ts, helpers.ts, schema.ts, index.ts
- ✅ Tests reviewed: __tests__/unit.test.ts
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ No lint errors
- ✅ No type errors
- ✅ Error handling follows discriminated union pattern
- ✅ Effect.Service pattern correctly implemented
- ✅ Naming conventions followed (SearchClientApi interface, SearchClient service class)
- ✅ Uses shared error detection helpers from httpClient

**Key Fixes Applied**:
- Converted `SearchClientApi` type to interface with comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Added detailed JSDoc documentation for the `search()` method including parameter descriptions and examples
- Uses `isHttpErrorWithStatus` helper from httpClient for error detection
- Error translation properly maps HTTP 400 errors to `SearchQueryError`
- Error translation properly maps other HTTP errors to `MemoryValidationError`
- Base64 encoding/decoding helpers properly implemented
- Filter encoding helper correctly handles arrays and single values

**Architecture Notes**:
- SearchClient performs semantic search against memories stored via SupermemoryClient
- Uses HTTP GET request to `/api/v1/search` endpoint
- Results are ranked by relevance score and can be filtered by metadata, age, and relevance thresholds
- Properly decodes Base64-encoded memory values from API responses
- Follows same configuration pattern as SupermemoryClient (uses SupermemoryClientConfigType)
