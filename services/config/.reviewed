**Review Summary**:
- ✅ All files reviewed: api.ts, schema.ts, service.ts, helpers.ts
- ✅ Tests reviewed: __tests__/unit.test.ts, __tests__/integration.test.ts
- ✅ All tests passing (19/19)
- ✅ No lint errors
- ✅ No type errors
- ✅ Schema properly organized in schema.ts using Schema.Class pattern
- ✅ Environment variable mapping typed using schema keys
- ✅ Helper functions properly extracted and organized
- ✅ Error handling follows discriminated union pattern
- ✅ Effect.Service pattern correctly implemented
- ✅ Configuration follows single source of truth pattern

**Key Fixes Applied**:
- Moved SupermemoryConfig type definition from types.ts to api.ts
- Created schema.ts file with Schema.Class for environment variables
- Extracted environment variable reading logic into helpers.ts
- Typed ENV_VARS using schema keys for type safety
- Fixed type assertions for effect-env version mismatch
- Created comprehensive unit and integration tests
- All imports follow namespace vs named import best practices

**Architecture Notes**:
- Schema defined as Schema.Class in schema.ts
- Environment variable names typed using Record<keyof Schema.Schema.Type<typeof SupermemoryConfigEnv>, string>
- Helper functions separated: readEnvVars, parseNumericConfig, buildConfigFromEnv
- Constants organized: ENV_VARS, DEFAULTS
- Service uses buildConfigFromEnv() helper for clean implementation
