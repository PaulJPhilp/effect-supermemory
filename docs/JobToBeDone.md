That is a great framing. The Job to be Done (JTBD) cuts through the "what" and hits the "why." It will act as the north star for the documentation and the pitch.

Here is the **Job to be Done** statement for `effect-supermemory`.

### Job to be Done: `effect-supermemory`

**The Situation:**
When I am architecting a complex, long-running AI agent or system using Effect-TS...

**The Motivation:**
...I want to equip it with persistent, semantic memory without polluting my robust Effect codebase with fragile, untyped API calls or managing complex vector state manually...

**The Expected Outcome:**
...So that my agent can recall user context and facts reliably, treating "Memory" as just another stable, type-safe dependency that either works perfectly or fails predictably, allowing me to sleep at night knowing my system is sound.

**Condensed Tagline:**
"Treat Semantic Memory as a Sound Dependency, not a side-effect."
